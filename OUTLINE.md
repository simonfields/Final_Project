Coding task for 4/27

The goal I've decided for this project is to try and simulate different phenomena, such as the presence of dust or other particles, at
(different?) Lagrangian points. 

My first thought for coding is to tackle Newman's exercise 6.16, "The Lagrange Point", as the topic is relevant and I may be able to
get more insight on my project. 

I will also look for a system in which I can simulate particles for later use, and possible other variables to add.


4/27 - 5/1
I will most likely use PyParticles to simulate the dust phenomenon at LP. By the end of the week, I'd like to have working plots
of the Earth-moon (or possibly Earth-sun, more likely I will end up with both)

As of right now, I'm not sure what my plots will look like, or what information they will give me. From my knowledge of LP,
I know that the congregation of particles or satellites in a stable LP is very possible, so one question I want to ask is "how much dust is too much?"
