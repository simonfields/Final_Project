Coding task for 4/27

The goal I've decided for this project is to try and simulate different phenomena, such as the presence of dust or other particles, at
(different?) Lagrangian points. 

My first thought for coding is to tackle Newman's exercise 6.16, "The Lagrange Point", as the topic is relevant and I may be able to
get more insight on my project. 

I will also look for a system in which I can simulate particles for later use, and possible other variables to add.
