# Final_Project
Computational Physics Spring 2020


My project involves looking at a system of two bodies and their Lagrangian Points. More specifically, this includes analyzing Lagrangian Points (referred to as LP) with outside (intersystem) factors, such as dust particles. The goal of this simulation is to provide information on possible phenomena that occur in LP and prepare for possible problems we might face in the event LP are used for spaceflight applications.
